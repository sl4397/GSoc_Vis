This Shiny App is about global temperature visulization. I used data from 
https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
to create three visualization tags.

1. A line plot to show temperature change across years for selected country. User can choose layers to add on the line plot:
add uncertainty and fit a smoother. User can also specify the smoother parameter on the slider.

2. A scatter plot to show the relationship between temperatures of two selected contries. User can choose the 
'fit linear regression' option which fits a linear regression line on the scatter plot.

3. A bar plot to show average temperature by country arranged in a descending order.
